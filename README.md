# Zomato_Data_Analysis

This project involves analyzing restaurant data from Zomato, a popular restaurant discovery platform. The dataset contains various attributes such as restaurant name, location, ratings, cuisine, online ordering availability, etc. The project aims to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and extract insights from the data using Python and various data analysis libraries.

The project workflow includes:

## Data Collection: Fetching data from a SQLite database containing Zomato restaurant data.

## Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, converting data types, and preprocessing text data for analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
1. Analyzing the relationship between online order availability and restaurant ratings.
2. Performing text analysis on customer reviews for Quick Bites restaurants using unigram, bigram, and trigram analysis.
3. Extracting geographical coordinates of restaurant locations and visualizing the distribution of North Indian, South Indian, and Chinese cuisine restaurants using heatmaps.

## Automation: Designing a function to automate the analysis process for different cuisine types.

The project aims to provide insights into various aspects of restaurant data, such as customer preferences, popular cuisines, restaurant distribution across different areas, and the relationship between online ordering and ratings. This information can be valuable for restaurant owners, investors, and stakeholders in the food industry to make data-driven decisions.
